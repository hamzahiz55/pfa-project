# Manual Jenkins Test

Since ArgoCD has repository access issues, let's test Jenkins automation:

## Test Jenkins Manually:
1. Go to: http://localhost:8080/job/aws-s3-manager-pipeline/
2. Click "Build Now" to test if Jenkins can access your repository
3. Check if it can clone from: https://github.com/hamzahizi55/aws-s3-manager-new.git

## Expected Results:
- ✅ If Jenkins can clone: Repository access works, just need to fix ArgoCD
- ❌ If Jenkins fails: Need to update Jenkins repository URL manually

## Automation Status:
- Jenkins Git Polling: Configured (every 5 minutes)
- Jenkins Repository: Needs manual update to your new repo
- ArgoCD: Repository access issue

## Next Steps:
1. Test Jenkins manual build
2. Fix ArgoCD repository access
3. Wait for automatic triggering

# Setup Personal Repository for Full Automation

## Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository

### Manual Steps:
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `aws-s3-manager-pipeline`
3. **Description**: `AWS S3 Manager with Jenkins & ArgoCD automation`
4. **Visibility**: Public (or Private with your preference)
5. **Initialize**: ❌ Don't add README, .gitignore, or license (we'll push existing code)
6. **Click**: "Create repository"

### After creation, you'll get a URL like:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aws-s3-manager-pipeline.git`

## Step 2: Update Everything

Once you have your repository URL, I'll help you:

1. ✅ Update git remote to your new repo
2. ✅ Update Jenkins pipeline configuration  
3. ✅ Update ArgoCD application
4. ✅ Push all commits
5. ✅ Test full automation!

## What You'll Need:
- Your GitHub username
- Your new repository URL
- Your current GitHub token (should work with your own repo)

## Expected Timeline:
- Setup: 2-3 minutes
- Push commits: 30 seconds
- ArgoCD sync: 1-3 minutes
- Jenkins build: 2-5 minutes
- **Total**: Full automation working in ~10 minutes!
